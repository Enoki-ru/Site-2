# CSS
Through CSS, I have connected several fonts from the Rubik family. Also, at the root, I have prescribed the main variables, changing which you can achieve different results. In a previous job, I was asked to work on +- normal viewing through the phone, well, I think you can read now!

# Animations 
There are only two animations made on the site, the first is a small permanent glow effect at the h2 headers, animated through CSS

The second simplest animation is switching the "open" class at the side menu, using a click on the icon using the simplest JS functions, followed by animation via CSS

I agree, it was possible to attach the relative position of the icon to the left menu, but for some reason it only came to me now. I also used the standard settings of the swiperjs library to create a swiper

All links are useable, and you can even find a RickRoll link in 1 of them.
# Icons
I used library Ioniocns (https://ionic.io/ionicons) for all icons on this site.
